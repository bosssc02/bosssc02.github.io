									<h1>Past Experiences</h1>
									<p>
										In my pervious school I have taken some classes about differt web languages html/css, Javascript, PHP, SQL(Used with PHP).
										In using these languages I have tried different text editors notepad, notepad++, sublime. I am looking forward in seeing what textwrangler is like.
										Also at my previous school I had a chance to design and build my own website with a group of people, and to publish it. Making the website was a lot of fun
										and push me to find how to do things I have see on the internet before. The website I made for the class was for an animal shelter that I work at. Since finishing the project last spring, I have throughout the summer worked on it to make it better. Here is a link to this website <a href="http://palspets.us" target="_blank">PalsPet</a>.
